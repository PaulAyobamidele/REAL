MAINTAIN "Pedestrian Safety"
    by
        "Pedestrian Check" using "Perception Module"
            operationalized as
                "Detect Pedestrian" performed by "yolov5s"
                taking input "image" producing output "pedestrian detection confidence" & "pedestrian detection flag"
    followed by
        "braking" using "braking module"
            operationalized as
                "Bring down throttle" & "Apply Brakes" if "pedestrian detection flag=True" performed by "proportional_braking"
                taking input "pedestrian detection flag" producing output "Braking Status Flag"
    in scenario where
        "A pedestrian trying to cross the street in fog."
    ensuring "vehicle resumes within 10 s once the crossing is clear"
